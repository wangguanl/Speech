DFlash speculative decoding with vLLM
======================================

The NeMo SpeechLM vLLM plugin supports checkpoint-backed DFlash and DFlash2
speculative decoding. Both use intermediate hidden states from the SpeechLM
language tower to condition a separate draft model; generated draft tokens are
verified by the target model, so accepted output remains lossless relative to
the target.

Requirements
------------

* A vLLM-ready NeMo SpeechLM checkpoint whose language backbone is compatible
  with the DFlash draft.
* vLLM 0.28.0, the version pinned by NeMo's ``vllm`` extra.
* An attention backend that supports the draft model's non-causal attention.

Automodel is not required to serve an exported checkpoint. Install the ASR
runtime and pinned vLLM serving dependencies with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e ".[asr,vllm]"

The equivalent uv command is:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv sync --extra asr --extra vllm

Do not combine ``vllm`` with the ``speechlm2``, ``speechlm2-only``,
``all``, ``cu12``, ``cu13``, ``compiled``, or ``compiled-a100`` extras. These
include Automodel training dependencies; vLLM owns the exact Torch and
CUDA-kernel stack for this serving environment.

The following example uses the published NVFP4 DFlash draft for the Nemotron
3.5 Lightning 30B-A3B backbone and proposes six tokens per decoding step:

.. code-block:: bash

   vllm serve /path/to/vllm-ready-speechlm-checkpoint \
     --trust-remote-code \
     --speculative-config '{
       "method": "dflash",
       "model": "nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-NVFP4-DFlash",
       "num_speculative_tokens": 6
     }'

The target SpeechLM checkpoint must use
``nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16`` as its language backbone.
The draft checkpoint provides the auxiliary target-layer selection and mask
token configuration consumed by vLLM; no draft weights are bundled with NeMo.
Automodel-trained drafts may retain ``Qwen3DFlashDraftModel`` as their
architecture so they can be reopened for training. The NeMo plugin registers
that name as an alias of vLLM's native ``DFlashDraftModel`` implementation;
serve the original checkpoint without rewriting its ``config.json``.

DFlash2 inference
-----------------

DFlash2 adds dynamic convolutions and a candidate-path selector to the draft
model. Its checkpoint must be trained or fine-tuned separately for the target
language backbone; NeMo's vLLM inference plugin does not create or convert
DFlash2 weights.

DFlash2 support is included in the pinned vLLM 0.28.0 release. DFlash2 uses
the same ``method`` value as DFlash; vLLM selects it from the trained draft
checkpoint's architecture:

.. code-block:: bash

   vllm serve /path/to/vllm-ready-speechlm-checkpoint \
     --trust-remote-code \
     --speculative-config '{
       "method": "dflash",
       "model": "/path/to/trained-lightning-dflash2-checkpoint",
       "num_speculative_tokens": 6
     }'

NeMo Automodel training exports ``Qwen3DFlash2DraftModel`` so the checkpoint
can still be reopened by the training stack. The SpeechLM plugin normalizes
that architecture to vLLM's canonical ``DFlash2DraftModel`` before vLLM wraps
the speculative config. This is required for vLLM to force its V2 model runner
and execute the DFlash2 candidate-selector speculator instead of silently
falling back to plain DFlash. Native configs that already declare
``DFlash2DraftModel`` remain supported.

The draft's ``dflash_config`` must include ``target_layer_ids``,
``conv_group_size``, ``conv_kernel_size``, ``selector_rank``, and
``selector_top_k``. Set
``num_speculative_tokens`` to one less than the convolution block size used to
train the draft: vLLM constructs each runtime block from one anchor plus the
configured number of draft tokens and does not reject a training/inference
block-size mismatch.

The DFlash2 architecture forces vLLM's V2 model runner, including for hybrid
NemotronH targets that would otherwise use V1. vLLM raises an error for features
it knows are incompatible with V2, but the target and serving configuration
should still be qualified on that runner. The SpeechLM target uses the same
``SupportsEagle3`` hidden-state contract for DFlash and DFlash2, so no draft
weights or training logic are bundled with NeMo.

Validation
----------

Compare greedy generation with and without ``--speculative-config`` using the
same text and audio prompts. The generated token IDs must match. Also inspect
vLLM's speculative-decoding metrics to confirm that draft tokens are proposed
and accepted; matching output alone does not prove that DFlash was active.
